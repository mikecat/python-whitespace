python-whitespace

This is Whitespace interpreter written in Python.
It seems to work with Python 2.7 and Python 3.3

How to use:
    as a standalone interpreter:
        $ python whitespace.py <Whitespace program file>
    as a component:
        1. Translate Whitespace program into a list of commands and labels
            compiled_program = compile_whitespace(program_str)
        2. Execute the translated program data
            output = run_whitespace(compiled_program,input)

Notice:
    - This software may contain bugs, misinpremention of the specification
      or other faults.
    - Unlike the original interpreter, the "read a number" function
      works like scanf("%d",&input) in C language.
      It means that we can input multiple integers separated by spaces
      in one line when using this interpreter.
